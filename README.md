- Created a basic selection tool for the player inventory, as well as a selection tool which displays information about the selected weapon.
  This tool will eventually house other features, such as equiping, dropping, or examining an item. 

**Pre 8-24-2016**
-Basic skeleton created and very simple inventory was set up. Limited features. Still very early in production. 

**To Do**
-
- 1) Add more functionality to selection tool
- 2) Create selection tools for equipted item menu
- 3) Create monsters
- 4) Add combat scenarios
- 5) Add story and procedural generation
- 6) Implement an item database
- 7) Add store
- 8) Add savegame and loadgame
- 9) Create better start menu
- 10) Create combat engine
- 11) Experience and levelling
- 12) Item drops
- 13) Goals, achivements, etc.

**Language used** 
- C++ ( using Visual Studio )
- There are currently some Microsoft-only features, and so these will be eliminated once most of the game has been brought to a playable point, so as to allow for a more portable game ( able to be played on Linux, etc. ). Efficiency will also be improved once the majority of the game has reached a playable state. 

-Please Feel free to give suggestions on content, or to leave any other feedback.

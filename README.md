  Created a basic selection tool for the player inventory, as well as a selection tool which displays information about the selected weapon.
  This tool will eventually house other features, such as equiping, dropping, or examining an item. 

**Pre 8-24-2016**
-Basic skeleton created and very simple inventory was set up. Limited features. Still very early in production.

- 2) Create selection tools for equipted item menu
- 3) Create monsters
- 4) Add combat scenarios
- 5) Add story and procedural generation
- 6) Implement an item database

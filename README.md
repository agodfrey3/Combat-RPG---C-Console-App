- Added a system to both equip and display equipped items. The combat interface has also been updated slightly, however, more imporvements will be made to both the equip screens, and the combat interface, as well as combat itself. Some bug fixes were also implemented, such as fixing memory leaks and eliminating unused variables.

- Created a basic selection tool for the player inventory, as well as a selection tool which displays information about the selected weapon.
  This tool will eventually house other features, such as equiping, dropping, or examining an item. 

**Pre 8-24-2016**
-Basic skeleton created and very simple inventory was set up. Limited features. Still very early in production. 

**To Do**
-
- 1) Add more functionality to selection tool
- 2) Create selection tools for equipted item menu
- 3) Create monsters
- 4) Add combat scenarios
- 5) Add story and procedural generation
- 6) Implement an item database
- 7) Add store
- 8) Add savegame and loadgame
- 9) Create better start menu
- 10) Create combat engine
- 11) Experience and levelling
- 12) Item drops
- 13) Goals, achivements, etc.

**Language used** 
- C++ ( using Visual Studio )
- There are currently some Microsoft-only features, and so these will be eliminated once most of the game has been brought to a playable point, so as to allow for a more portable game ( able to be played on Linux, etc. ). Efficiency will also be improved once the majority of the game has reached a playable state. 

-Please Feel free to give suggestions on content, or to leave any other feedback. 

-Note: gameHandler is the main class used. The main.cpp is simply a driver
